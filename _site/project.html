<h2 class="tophead">Course Project</h2>

<p>Your course project should address an important, interesting open
problem related to computer security.  It's up to you to find a good
topic, but we are happy to discuss your project ideas individually
and help you refine them.</p>

<p>We recommend working in groups of 3 or 4. The larger the group, the
more we'll expect you to accomplish.</p>

<a name="preprop"></a><h3>Pre-Proposal Presentation &mdash; In class, February 16</h3>

<p>Give a 5 minute presentation explaining the problem you want to
work on, the most important related work, and your tentative approach.
This will be an early opportunity to get feedback from the class.

<a name="proposal"></a><h3>Written Proposal &mdash; Due Thursday, March 9</h3>

<p>Your proposal should consist of a 2&ndash;3 page description of
your project that includes the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Group:</b> Group member names and uniqnames.
<li><b>Title:</b> What would you call the eventual paper or product?
<li><b>Problem:</b> A description of the problem you will address and why it is important.
<li><b>Context:</b> A survey of related work and past approaches to the problem.
<li><b>Approach:</b> How you will address the problem and how your approach differs from past work.
<li><b>Evaluation:</b> How you will test how well your approach works (e.g., experimental measurements).
<li><b>Scope:</b> What you plan to accomplish and deliver by the checkpoint and by the end of the semester.
</ol>

<p>Email your proposal to <a href="mailto:eecs588.w17@umich.edu">eecs588.w17@umich.edu</a>.</p></p>

<a name="checkpoint"></a><h3>Project Checkpoint &mdash; Due Tuesday, April 4</h3>

<p>Write a concise status report (no more than two pages) answering
the following questions:

<ol>
<li><b>Progress:</b> What have you accomplished so far?  What do you have left to do?
<li><b>Schedule:</b> Are you on track to complete what you proposed?
<li><b>Obstacles:</b> Have you encountered any surprises or unexpected problems? 
<li><b>Workarounds:</b> If you're having problems, how do you intend to solve them or work around them?
<li><b>Preliminary results:</b> Can you draw any preliminary conclusions from your results so far?  Include data.
</ol>

<p>Email your status report to <a href="mailto:eecs588.w17@umich.edu">eecs588.w17@umich.edu</a>.  You're also welcome to come see us if you need advice.</p>

<a name="present"></a><h3>Project Presentation &mdash; In class, April 11 and 13</h3>

<p>The last full week of class is set aside for the <b>9th Annual EECS&nbsp;588
Security Symposium</b>. Each group will give an in-class
presentation about their results, in the style of a brief conference talk.
These will be rapid fire talks; you'll have <b>10 minutes</b> to speak and 5 minutes for questions.

<p>We will assign presentation timeslots and post the schedule here in
early April.</p>

<p>The length of your report should not exceed 8 typeset pages,
excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. There is no limit
on the length of appendices, but graders are not required to read
them. The text must be formatted in two columns, using 10 point Times
Roman type on 12 point leading, in a text block of 6.5&rdquo; by
9&rdquo;.  We <i>strongly encourage</i> you to
use <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and
the <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates">
USENIX template files</a>,
and <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> might be a
helpful collaboration platform.  Please submit your report via email
to
<a href="mailto:eecs588.w17@umich.edu">eecs588.w17@umich.edu</a>.</p>

<h3>Submitting Your Work for Publication</h3>

<p>You should consider submitting your results to a technical workshop.
There are <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity17">several
workshops</a> held annually in conjunction with USENIX Security that
have deadlines in late April and May.  We'll be glad to advise you
further in preparation for submission.</p>
