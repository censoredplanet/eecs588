<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Find a partner.  If you have trouble, try posting to Piazza.</li>
  <li>Topic assignments: Review the list of topics below and
  assign each topic a preference score from 0&ndash;3 stars.
  Email your nonzero preferences, along with the uniqnames of you and
  your partner,
  to <a href="mailto:eecs588@umich.edu">eecs588@umich.edu</a>
  by <b>5pm on Friday, September 15</b>.  Let me know if there are
  connections to your research area (e.g. machine learning or wireless
  networking), and I'll take these into account when making assignments.
  Many topics include optional <b>bonus challenges</b>; I'll
  award extra credit for these in proportion to the difficulty.</li>
  <li>Once you've been assigned an attack, your task is to understand
  it and write an original exploit.  Don't borrow from pre-packaged
  attack tools; you may, however, use general purpose tools such as
  disassemblers and packet sniffers.  Some vulnerabilities have been
  fixed in newer software, so you may need to target an old
  version.</li>
  <li>Per the course ethics policy, you <b><u>must not</u></b> test
  your attack against any systems &ldquo;in the wild&rdquo; except as
  noted.  If you need demonstration targets, set up your own isolated
  test systems or VMs.  Construct your demo with safety in mind: it
  should be difficult to use against real systems even if it were to
  fall into the wrong hands.</li>
  <li>Teach the class about the attack in a 20 minute presentation on the assigned date.
  Be sure to:
  <ol type=a>
    <li>Describe how the attack works, how it was discovered, how it
    was disclosed, and what danger it poses.
    <li>Talk about how you implemented it, including any technical challenges you faced.
    <li>Give a demonstration of your exploit.  (Carefully test your demo first!)
    <li>Draw broader lessons from the attack.  What does it teach us about security?
    <li>Discuss defenses against the attack.  If the attack has been
    fixed, describe how similar problems might be averted in the
    future; if it's still a threat, suggest some defenses that might
    be investigated in new research.
  </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Topics</h3>

<p><b>Note on early topics:</b> Since the first few groups will have
limited time to prepare, grading will be relatively generous.</p>

Eve is monitoring some of the clients and wants to determine which of them visit a particular website.  She enlists the help of Mallory, a man-in-the-middle on the web server&rsquo;s upstream connection.  Mallory inserts a watermark into the server&rsquo;s outbound traffic&mdash;say, by manipulating packet timing to create jitter with a distinct distribution&mdash;and Eve tries to detect the watermark in each client&rsquo;s inbound traffic.
