<p>This intensive research seminar covers foundational work and
current topics in computer systems security.  We will read research
papers and discuss attacks and defenses against operating systems,
client-side software, web applications, and IP networks.  Students
will be prepared for research in computer security and for
security-related research in other subareas, and they will gain
hands-on experience designing and evaluating secure systems.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Topic List</h2>

<p>There will be many opportunities to tailor the course to your
backgrounds and interests.  The tentative list of topics below should
give you an idea of what to expect. See <a href="readings.html">reading list</a> for additional details.  Please
get in touch if you have questions or suggestions.

<h2>Grading</h2>

There will be no exams.  Instead, your grade will be based on the
following:

<p><b>Class Participation (5%)</b> &mdash; We will read one&ndash;two research papers for each class. After paper presentation by a group, we will discuss the strengths, weaknesses, scope, and future research areas related to the paper. <span class="note">Note that the discussion part of a lecture will <b>not</b> be recorded, but the paper presentation will be recorded and available on Canvas.</span> Please try to attend the class discussions and be prepared to make
substantive intellectual contributions. Participation on Canvas and Piazza discussions will also be considered towards this grade.</p>

<p><b><a href="readings.html">Paper Responses</a>
(15%)</b> &mdash; You are required to write a short critical response
for each paper we read (excluding <i>recommended</i> papers). Responses are due at
the beginning of class. You will also review and ratee your peers' reviews after the class. Look for evidence that the reviewever thought carefully about the topic. </p>

<p><b>Paper Presentation
(20%)</b> &mdash; Working with a partner, choose one of the topics from the reading list, read both the required and recommended papers, and prepare a 60 minute presentation. 30 minutes of your presentation should discuss details of the required paper and and the other 30 minutes should present an overview of the recommended papers and general research in the area. <span class="note">This part of the class will be recorded and made available on Canvas.</span> You will receive a Google Form after the first class that will let you choose a topic of preferance.</p>

<p><b><a href="project.html">Research Project</a>
(50%)</b> &mdash; You will conduct an extended research project during
the semester, with the goal of writing a publishable workshop paper.
This work should be done in a group of size appropriate to the scope
of your investigation.  Typical project topics involve analyzing the
security of a system or developing a new security mechanism.</p>


<h2>Ethics, Law, and University Policies</h2>
<p>
  To defend a system, you need to be able to think like an attacker,
  and that includes understanding techniques that can be used to
  compromise security. However, using those techniques in the real
  world may violate the law or the university&rsquo;s rules, and it
  may be unethical. Under some circumstances, even probing for
  weaknesses may result in severe penalties, up to and including
  expulsion, civil fines, and jail time.  Our policy in EECS 588 is
  that you must respect the privacy and property rights of others at
  all times, <b><u>or else you will fail the course</u></b>.
</p>
<p>
  Acting lawfully and ethically is your responsibility.  Carefully read
  the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">Computer
  Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA), a federal statute that broadly
  criminalizes computer intrusion. This is one of several laws that
  govern &ldquo;hacking.&rdquo; Understand what the law prohibits
  &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to end up
  like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin_email_hack">this
  guy</a>. The EFF provides helpful advice
  on <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/vulnerability-reporting-faq">vulnerability
  reporting</a>
  and <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/grey-hat-guide">other
  legal matters</a>.  If in doubt, we can refer you to an attorney.
</p>
<p>
  Please
  review <a href="http://www.itcs.umich.edu/itcsdocs/r1103/">ITS&rsquo;s
  policies on responsible use of technology resources</a>
  and <a href="http://caen.engin.umich.edu/policies">CAEN&rsquo;s
  policy documents</a> for guidelines concerning proper use of
  information technology at U-M, as well as
  the <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~aey/eecs206/honor.pdf">Engineering Honor
  Code</a>. As members of the university, you are required to abide by
  these policies.
