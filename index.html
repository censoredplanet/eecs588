<p>This intensive research seminar covers foundational work and
current topics in computer systems security.  We will read research
papers and discuss attacks and defenses against operating systems,
client-side software, web applications, and IP networks.  Students
will be prepared for research in computer security and for
security-related research in other subareas, and they will gain
hands-on experience designing and evaluating secure systems.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Topic List</h2>

<p>There will be many opportunities to tailor the course to your
backgrounds and interests.  The tentative list of topics below should
give you an idea of what to expect. See <a href="readings.html">reading list</a> for additional details.  Please
get in touch if you have questions or suggestions.




<h3>Network security</h3>
<a href="static/key.jpg"><img style="display: block; background-color: white; padding: 8px 10px; margin: 0 0 10px 10px; border:1px solid #888; float:right;" src="static/key_sm.jpg"></a>
  <small>The security mindset, thinking like an attacker, reasoning about risk, research ethics<br>
  Network protocols security: TCP and DNS &ndash; attacks and defenses<br>
  Policing packets: Firewalls, VPNs, intrusion detection<br>
  Denial of service attacks, botnets and defenses<br>
  Mobile security
</small>

<h3>Cryptography and Web Security</h3>
<small>Key exchange, public-key cryptography, key management, the TLS protocol<br/>
The browser security model<br>
Web site attacks and defenses: cross-site scripting, SQL injection, cross-site request forgery<br>
Human factors and usability</small>

<h3>Software Security</h3>
<small>
Malware: viruses, spyware, rootkits &ndash; operation and detection<br>
Automated security testing and tools for writing secure code<br>
Virtualization, sandboxing, and OS-level defenses<br>
Machine learning, adversarial machine learning
</small>

<h3>Special Topics</h3>

<small>
Hardware security &ndash; attacks and defenses<br>
Critical systems, physical attacks<br>
Data privacy, anonymity, censorship, surveillance</small>

<h2>Grading</h2>

There will be no exams.  Instead, your grade will be based on the
following:

<p><b>Class Participation (5%)</b> &mdash; We will read two research
papers for each class.  Come prepared to discuss them and make
substantive intellectual contributions.</p>

<p><b><a href="readings.html">Paper Responses</a>
(15%)</b> &mdash; You are required to write a short critical response
for each paper we read.  I'll look for evidence that you read
the paper and thought carefully about the topic.  Responses are due at
the beginning of class.</p>

<p><b><a href="attacks.html">Paper Presentation</a>
(20%)</b> &mdash; Working with a partner, choose a topic from the reading list and 
read 3-4 more recent papers and provide a 20 minute presentation about the current state of a research area at the start of Tuesday's class.</p>

<p><b><a href="project.html">Research Project</a>
(50%)</b> &mdash; You will conduct an extended research project during
the semester, with the goal of writing a publishable workshop paper.
This work should be done in a group of size appropriate to the scope
of your investigation.  Typical project topics involve analyzing the
security of a system or developing a new security mechanism.</p>


<h2>Ethics, Law, and University Policies</h2>
<p>
  To defend a system, you need to be able to think like an attacker,
  and that includes understanding techniques that can be used to
  compromise security. However, using those techniques in the real
  world may violate the law or the university&rsquo;s rules, and it
  may be unethical. Under some circumstances, even probing for
  weaknesses may result in severe penalties, up to and including
  expulsion, civil fines, and jail time.  Our policy in EECS 588 is
  that you must respect the privacy and property rights of others at
  all times, <b><u>or else you will fail the course</u></b>.
</p>
<p>
  Acting lawfully and ethically is your responsibility.  Carefully read
  the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">Computer
  Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA), a federal statute that broadly
  criminalizes computer intrusion. This is one of several laws that
  govern &ldquo;hacking.&rdquo; Understand what the law prohibits
  &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to end up
  like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin_email_hack">this
  guy</a>. The EFF provides helpful advice
  on <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/vulnerability-reporting-faq">vulnerability
  reporting</a>
  and <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/coders/grey-hat-guide">other
  legal matters</a>.  If in doubt, we can refer you to an attorney.
</p>
<p>
  Please
  review <a href="http://www.itcs.umich.edu/itcsdocs/r1103/">ITS&rsquo;s
  policies on responsible use of technology resources</a>
  and <a href="http://caen.engin.umich.edu/policies">CAEN&rsquo;s
  policy documents</a> for guidelines concerning proper use of
  information technology at U-M, as well as
  the <a href="http://honorcode.engin.umich.edu/">Engineering Honor
  Code</a>. As members of the university, you are required to abide by
  these policies.
