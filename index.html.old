            <p>This intensive research course covers foundational work and
            current topics in computer systems security.  We will analyze research
            papers, write technical essays, and carry out benchtop experiments.  Students
            will be prepared for graduate research in computer
            security. Students will
            learn methodologies for reproducible research, and
            experience the art of technical writing to
            communicate complex thoughts in simple prose. Students will gain
            hands-on experience designing and evaluating secure
            computer systems.</p>


<h2><a name="prereq">**</a>Prereqs</h2>

<p>This is a course designed for PhD students. Upper-level undergraduates with experience in computer engineering
or computer system security (e.g., EECS473, EECS388) may contact staff for consideration of an override.
Email the staff a paragraph on your computer engineering and/or security experience (with previous grades) and how
graduate-level research in embedded security would fit in your career
plans.  The official prereqs are certain EECS courses that the
instructor has never attended or taken.  Having experience in computer
engineering or electronics will give you an advantage, but we
will teach students how to use basic benchtop electronics
	    equipment.  Students should have a mastery of
	    English exposition.</p>

            <h2>Grading</h2>

            There will be no exams.  Instead, your grade will be based on the
            following:

            <p><b>Class Participation and Paper Presentation (15%)</b>
            &mdash; Every week, we will suggest supplementary papers
            associated with the core reading.  Each student will have
            an opportunity for one five-minute presentation on a recent
            paper.  Pedantic use of slides are frowned upon unless there are key
           measurements difficult to convey in chalk.

            </p>

            <p><b><a href="readings.html">Essays</a>
                (20%)</b> &mdash; Most weeks, students will write a one-page
            essay pertaining to a research question posed in the
                context of a published paper.  We'll look for evidence of
                critical thinking and analysis rather than merely summarizing a paper. Responses are due before
            the beginning of lecture.  Essays must be PDF (no Word), double spaced,
                11pt or 12pt font, and 1 inch margins. The header must
                contain a meaningful title, your name, and date. You
                may turn in essays early, especially when 
                traveling;
                late essays will receive a zero.  To accommodate for
                illness and other unavoidable and unexpected
                interruptions, we will automatically drop your
                lowest essay grade when tabulating final grades.</p>

            <p><b><a href="labs.html">Hands-on Labs</a>
                (20%)</b> &mdash; Working in small teams, students
                will carry out
                several homework assignments pertaining to reproducing embedded
                security experiments from our paper reading.
                Homeworks range from learning how to use an
                oscilloscope to simple power analysis to extract
                cryptographic keys from a microcontroller. </p>

            <p><b><a href="project.html">Research Project</a>
                (45%)</b> &mdash; You will conduct an extended research project during
            the semester, with the goal of writing a publishable workshop paper.
            This work should be done in a small group of 2-3 students.
                Typical project topics involve reproducing previously
                published research to find interesting new directions or analyzing the
            security of a system or developing a new security mechanism.</p>


            <h2>Ethics, Law, and University Policies</h2>
            <p>
            To defend a system, you need to be able to think like an attacker,
            and that includes understanding techniques that can be used to
            compromise security. However, using those techniques in the real
            world may violate the law or the university&rsquo;s rules, and it
            may be unethical. Under some circumstances, even probing for
            weaknesses may result in severe penalties, up to and including
            expulsion, civil fines, and jail time.  Our policy in EECS 588 is
            that you must respect the privacy and property rights of others at
            all times, <b><u>or else you will fail the course</u></b>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Acting lawfully and ethically is your responsibility.  Carefully read
            the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1030.html">Computer
                Fraud and Abuse Act</a> (CFAA), a federal statute that broadly
            criminalizes computer intrusion. This is one of several laws that
            govern &ldquo;hacking.&rdquo; Understand what the law prohibits
            &mdash; you don&rsquo;t want to end up
            like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Palin_email_hack">this
                guy</a>. The EFF provides helpful advice
